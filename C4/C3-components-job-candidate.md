# Components Diagram (C3) - Job Candidate

In the C4 model, C3 diagrams illustrate how components within a container operate and interact. For the **Job Candidate Management** container, we focus on how job candidates submit resumes, request AI-based tips, and manage their data, integrating relevant architectural decisions (ADRs).

### Job Candidate Overview

- **Asynchronous Integration**  
  The interaction with external systems for AI-based features, such as resume tips, is handled asynchronously, as detailed in [ADR-005](/ADR/ADR-005-async-with-external-systems.md).

- **External LLMs Usage**  
  The resume tips are generated by an external large language model (LLM), following guidelines set out in [ADR-007](/ADR/ADR-007-use-of-external-llms.md).

- **AI-Powered Resume Tips**  
  Job candidates can request feedback through the **AI Resume Tips Adapter**, which provides suggestions for improving their resumes. Once the tips are returned, they are stored in the job candidate's record via the **Resume Service**.

## Data Flow

### Requesting AI Resume Tips

1. The **Job candidate** requests resume tips through the **Job candidate API**.
2. The **Job candidate API** forwards the request to the **Resume Service**.
3. The **Resume Service** interacts asynchronously with the **AI Resume Tips Adapter**, as specified in [ADR-005](/ADR/ADR-005-async-with-external-systems.md).
4. The **AI Resume Tips Adapter** sends the resume data to the external **AI Resume Tips System**, which uses an external LLM per [ADR-007](/ADR/ADR-007-use-of-external-llms.md).
5. The **AI Resume Tips System** processes the request and sends the tips back to the **AI Resume Tips Adapter**.
6. The **AI Resume Tips Adapter** forwards the tips to the **Resume Service**.
7. The **Resume Service** stores the tips in the **Job Candidate Database** for the job candidate to access later.

### Submitting a Resume for Anonymization

1. The **Job candidate** submits their resume through the **Job candidate API**.
2. The **Job candidate API** forwards the resume to the **Resume Service**.
3. The **Resume Service** sends the resume to the **Story Container** for processing.
4. The **Story Container** handles anonymization, ensuring the resume is processed without revealing personally identifiable information.

### Managing Job candidate Information

1. The **Job candidate** can update or modify their information through the **Job candidate API**.
2. The **Job candidate API** interacts with the **Job candidate Service**, which accesses and updates the **Job Candidate Database**.
3. The **Job candidate Service** retrieves or stores the updated data in the **Shared Database** as needed.
