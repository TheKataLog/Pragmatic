# ADR-001: Use Domain Driven Design

## Date:

2024-09-23

## Status:

Accepted

## Context:

We have a limited amount of time to get to an initial architecture for the ClearView system.

## Decision:

We use [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) to get a common
understanding of the business problem at hand.
All team members, technical and non-technical can participate. [Event Stroming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) is used
as a technique to get to this first domain driven designs.

## Consequences:

- A common understanding is created
- A lot of time is spent on DDD, which might be missing otherwise
