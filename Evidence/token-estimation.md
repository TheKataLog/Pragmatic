## Prompt

Very simple example prompt, assuming prior extraction of text form PDFs:

"""

You will receive a resume of a person in the format of extracted text.
You need to transform this resume into a format called 'Story' that eliminates the chance of a decision based on certain factors. The factors to be eliminated will be described below.
Additionally, the 'Story' needs to be in a human readable format describing S.M.A.R.T goals that apply for this person.
A 'Story' should also contain around 1000 words as an introduction to the person so that a recruiter can quickly gain an overview of a persons experience, skills.

Now I will give you factors that should not be identifyable in the story to make discrimination impossible. These factors are:
- race
- sex
- gender
- sexual orientation
- health
- attractivity


The resume in the form of extracted text from a pdf, follows below:

--- an additional 700 Tokens, from using a sample resume---

"""

Total tokens:
Around 850

## Response

Token number depends on the number of words desired in the response.
We assume a story should contain around 400 Words, leading to around 1400 response tokens.
